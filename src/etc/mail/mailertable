# The sendmail(8) mailer table is used to override routing for particular
# non-local hostnames and domains (i.e., names other the local hostname
# or names listed in local-host-names).
#
# Rebuild by running as root:
#   makemap hash /etc/mail/mailertable < /etc/mail/mailertable
#
# Each line is of the form "mailer:domain" (without the quotes)
# where "mailer" is the internal mailer name, and "domain" is
# where to send the message.  See /usr/share/sendmail/README for
# more information.
